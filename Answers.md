1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

functional components are usually just js functions that take props as arguments. hence the name function-al. 

Class components requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element and uses state. 

1.  Describe state.

State is an object that determines how a component renders & behaves making the component reusable even if the data changes. 

1.  Describe props.
props allow you to bring new data to a component so that even if there are multiple components each one can have different data from other parts of the app.
